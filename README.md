 2D Basic Game Engine for RPGs

 Very basic Dragon Quest-inspired game engine for C#/.NET. Makes use of PNG's transparency for transparent sprite effects. This is for anyone who want to begin simple game development without really having to learn the ins and outs of a behemoth like Unity. 

 Raylib is very accessible for C grognards such as myself but those who prefer C# may find this approach to be more their speed.
